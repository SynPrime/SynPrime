Hi, I am Gino.

I have been a systems engineer for Linux-based systems since 2017.
I am currently managing and improving open source software for personal and professional use.

## Icinga 2

In my working life, I have migrated the monitoring system from Nagios to Icinga2. I also use this software for my private systems.
I am currently writing a small icinga2-formula for Salt.

## Salt

Salt of SaltStack plays a big role in my job. In the past, I established Salt in my current department.
I also manage my private systems with salt.

## MRBS

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the booking tool "MRBS" has been very important for my department. A large number of rooms are booked with MRBS.
The software has some limitations. I've spent much time to improve the software, written in PHP and JS.

## OpenHab

I am using OpenHab for my home automation. I love to write usefull automation scripts.
